## Database is a simple Object class that is a wrapper for a Dictionary.
## 
## A Database has a name database_name, and a Dictionary data, and can be debugged globally or locally with debug.
## [br]
## The main reason to use a Database Object in another class, or to extend a class from Database, is primarily for the debug and err features, but also the recursive find_data function.
## Databases can be used for functional operations using its tick methods.
