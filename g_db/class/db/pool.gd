extends RefData
## Pool is currently built on top of [RefData] as a means of ease when recursing many [RefData]s within each other on an arbitrary keying scheme.
## @experimental
##
## A Pool is a [RefData], but the functionality Pool implements is intended for support of managing internal Pools, which could also be called "subpools".
## [br][br]
## The primary feature that the Pool class implements is the instantiation of a new Pool or other classtype upon attempting to retrieve a key value when the key value does not already exist.
## [br][br]
## Essentially, internal pools can be made and/or already existing and retrieved using the [method get_pool] method. [br]
## The [method get_pool] method will call the [method make_new_pool] method if the at_key argument is not grabbable with [method grab].
## [br][br]
## When pooling internal pools that are of a classtype other Pool, but extending from Pool, a pool_class_name can be used to pull a class script that may be loaded by the g_libs/pools built-in [Registry] (if it is functional at this stage of development) using the [method ClassNameDB.try_instantiate] method.
## [br][br]
## The method [method get_fancy_pool] can be used be used to pop the value of at_key to the front of the params [Array], twice, so that if a new subpool is a type of [RefInstance], the at_key value will be applied to the new instance's [member RefInstance.name] and [member RefInstance.key], or whatever other first two parameters that new class uses in it's [method RefInstance._init] constructor method.
## [br][br]
## When operating across possibly multiple at_key values, multple subpools in one function call, one can use [method get_pools] or [method get_fancy_pools], both of which handle an at_keys [Array] instead of a singular at_key [Variant].
class_name Pool

# What is a Pool

#var pool: Callable = get_fancy_pool
#var pools: Callable = get_fancy_pools

## The method [method get_fancy_pools] will call [method get_fancy_pool] for every value within [param at_keys].

		var pool = get_fancy_pool(at_key, pool_class_name, extra_pool_parameters, pool_parent_instance)

	return pools

## The method [method get_fancy_pool] is a [method get_pool], which will append the [param extra_pool_parameters] to the params for the [method get_pool] which consists of two entries of [param at_key] at its beginning. [br][br]
## At this time, the method will first try to return [method Dictionary.get] from [member data], if [method Dictionary.has], but there is no mutex locking.

## The [method make_new_pool] method is intended to be called internally via the [method get_pool] function. [br][br]
## The new_pool will first attempt to be made using [method ClassNameDB.try_instantiate] using the [param pool_class_name] and [param pool_parameters] as arguments. [br][br]
## The new_pool will default to a [method Pool.new] if it can not be instantiated prior. [br][br]
## If a [param pool_parent_instance] is not null, the new_pool will apply it to the member [member RefInstance.parent_instance].

## The method [method get_pool] is a [method RefData.grab] which will instead [method set_pool] with the result of [method make_new_pool] if the result of [method has] with [param at_key] is false.
func get_pool(at_key:Variant, pool_class_name:String="pool", params:Array=[], parent:RefInstance=null) -> Pool:
	if at_key is Pool: return at_key# for validating that a value is already "pool", and not a key for finding that pool.
